# VulChatGPT

An IDA PRO plugin to help in finding vulnerabilites in binaries.

Use IDA PRO HexRays decompiler with OpenAI(ChatGPT) to find possible vulnerabilities in binaries 

Disclaimer, possible scenarios to find binary vulnerabilites may lead to false positives, however it has worked in many CTFs I have worked on (simple/medium ... some hard)

Inspired by Gepetto : https://github.com/JusticeRage/Gepetto

Install:

Drop python script on IDA Pro Plugin location.

To Use:

Right click on decompiled code , select "Find possible vulnerability in function"
