# VulChatGPT
Use IDA PRO HexRays decompiler with OpenAI(ChatGPT) to find possible vulnerabilities in binaries 

Disclaimer, possible scenarios to find binary vulnerabilites may lead to a lot of false positive, however it has worked in many CTFs I have worked on (simple/medium ... some hard)

Inspired by Gepetto : https://github.com/JusticeRage/Gepetto

Install:

Drop python script on IDA Pro Plugin location.

To Use:

Right click on decompiled code , select "Find possible vulnerability in function"
